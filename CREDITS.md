This project would not have been possible without the LANE Boys beinging able to stand on the shoulders of giants:


### Deviation

http://deviationtx.com/

A replacement firmware designed primarily for the Walkera Devo series RC Transmitters. Great project to study RC transmitter architecture.


### ER9X

https://github.com/MikeBland/mbtx

er9x/ersky9x radio firmware. This is how it all started. Thanks!


### libopencm3

http://libopencm3.org/

Open Source ARM Cortex M microcontroller library. Light-weight, easy to use, not too much abstraction. Just works!


### Material Design Lite

https://getmdl.io/

MDL allowed us to get a reasonable modern UI with little skills required. No complicated tool chain, just JS and CSS required.


### Google fonts

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto
https://design.google.com/icons/

The icon font was especially helpful to get consistent looking icons. Super!


### sw-precache

https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache

Need to make your web-app work offline? Unbelievably easy with this brilliant project!

### spinkit

http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/

A nice and easy to use library of CSS spinners.

### Gnu GCC

https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

Fantastic compiler. Any platform. Just works.


### OpenOCD

http://openocd.org/

Powerful debugger and programmer. Excellent out-of-the-box experience and soooo configurable.


### STM

http://www.st.com/

Excellent value for money micro-controllers. Their ST-Link debugger comes on inexpensive Nucleo boards and works great even for programming the Nordic MCU.


### Nordic

http://nordicsemi.com/

Great 2.4 GHz Radio, decent software stack, fair price. Thanks for opening up your SDK and documentation in the recent years!


### Node.js and npm

https://nodejs.org/en/
https://www.npmjs.com/

Normally we use Python for scripts and utilities. But since Node.js was needed for using Webpack anyway, we used it instead. Worked great thanks to the library support at npm.


### Webpack and "Developing with Webpack"

http://webpack.github.io/
http://survivejs.com/webpack/developing-with-webpack

Web front-end development has become surprisingly complicated -- tool-wise -- in the last years. Thanks due to the guide at survivejs we were able get Webpack do what we needed without having to spend a lot of time.


### JSHint, ESLint

http://jshint.com/
http://eslint.org/

Great to find mistakes in the editor before you see them in the console log of your browser.


### strftime for JavaScript

https://github.com/samsonjs/strftime

Pity that this functionality isn't in the Javascript Date library. Thanks for scratching an itch.


### Sortable

http://rubaxa.github.io/Sortable/

Brilliant library to enable interactive re-ordering of lists. Super-simple to use, yet powerful.


### Arduino / ESP8266 / makeEspArduino

http://arduino.cc/
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
https://github.com/plerup/makeEspArduino

Thanks to the onderful work of the ESP8622.com community, it is easy to get the module up-and running in the  Arduino environment. Using the fantastic makeEspArduino allowed us to use our favorite editor and only compile what has changed.


### ESPAsyncTCP / ESPAsyncWebServer

https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP

Sweet asynchronous web server for the ESP8622. Beautiful code!


### PathJS

https://github.com/mtrpcic/pathjs/blob/master/path.js

Old-skool client-side routing library that allowed us to make a single page web-app for the tiny server on the ESP8266. Surely considered outdated, but just right for our needs.


### Favicon Generator

http://realfavicongenerator.net/

Great on-line tool to make all the different flavors of icons needed to get a modern web-app integrated on various platforms.


### Mozilla Developer Network MDN

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

The MDN was extremely helpful to brush up on the latest web technologies. The articles are concise and link to references.


### StackOverflow

http://stackoverflow.com/

Have a programming-related problem? This excellent community sure has it solved already.


### DuckDuckGo

https://duckduckgo.com/

Just like Google was in the beginning.


### Can I Use.com

http://caniuse.com/

Extremely useful website to decide which of the hot new web technologies can be actually used.


### OpenSCAD

http://www.openscad.org/

The Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller. What a pleasure to use!
