This project would not have been possible without the LANE Boys beinging able to stand on the shoulders of giants:


### Deviation

http://deviationtx.com/

A replacement firmware designed primarily for the Walkera Devo series RC Transmitters. Great project to study RC transmitter architecture.


### ER9X

https://github.com/MikeBland/mbtx

er9x/ersky9x radio firmware. This is how it all started. Thanks!


### libopencm3

http://libopencm3.org/

Open Source ARM Cortex M microcontroller library. Light-weight, easy to use, not too much abstraction. Just works!


### Material Design Lite

MDL allowed us to get a reasonable modern UI with little skills required. No complicated tool chain, just JS and CSS required.


### Google fonts

The icon font was especially helpful to get consistent looking icons. Super!


### JSHint

Great to see mistakes before you find them in the console log of your browser.


### Gnu GCC

Fantastic compiler with so many backends. Just works.


### MDN

The MDN was extremely helpful to brush up on the latest web technologies. The articles are concise and link to references.


### Can I Use.com

Extremely useful website to make decisions which of the hot new technologies make sense to use.


### StackOverflow

Have a programming-related problem? This excellent community sure has it solved already, providing great solutions.

### DuckDuckGo

Just like Google was in the beginning.


### STM

Excellent value for money micro-controllers. Their ST-Link debugger comes on inexpensive Nucleo boards and works great even for programming the Nordic MCU.


### Nordic

Great 2.4 GHz Radio, decent software stack, fair price. Thanks for opening up your SDK and documentation in the recent years!


### Arduino / ESP8266

### node-js and npm

Normally we use Python for scripts and self-made development tools. But since NodeJS was needed for using Webpack anyway, we used it instead. Worked great thanks to the library support at npm.


### Webpack and http://survivejs.com/webpack/developing-with-webpack

Web front-end development has become surprisingly complicated tool-wise in the last yeards. Thanks due to the guide at survivejs we were able get it going without having to spend too much time on learning tools.


### https://github.com/mtrpcic/pathjs/blob/master/path.js

Old-skool router so that we could use a simple web server on the ESP8266. Surely considered outdated, but just right for our needs.


### http://realfavicongenerator.net/

Great on-line tool to make all the different flavors of icons needed to get a modern web-app integrated on various platforms.
