# How to get up and running

This project requires **intermediate** skills in electronics and micro-controller firmware. While the electronics are based on off-the-shelf modules, everything needs to be wired correctly on a prototyping board and installed in the transmitter.

On the software side, you need to be familiar with Git, the ARM GCC toolchain, GNU Make, OpenOCD and the ST-Link programmer. This project uses three different type of microcontrollers: STM32F103, Nordic nRF51822 and ESP8266.

The web interface and associated dev tools are built in JavaScript using NodeJS, Webpack and the Material Design Lite framework.

Don't be discouraged though: One can learn *anything* with the help of the Internet today. It is only up to *you* to invest the time. **A day where you learn something new is a good day.**
