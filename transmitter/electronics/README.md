This folder contains the schematics and layout of the *headless transmitter* hardware.

[BOM.txt](BOM.txt) contains a list of all components.

The project is made using [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/). For convenience the schematics are also available in [PDF format](stm32f1-nrf24l01-transmitter.pdf).

Note that the PCB designs are not actual circuit board designs, but rather meant to be built on a [Perfboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfboard).

There are different variants that we adapted to suit different transmitters we modified.
